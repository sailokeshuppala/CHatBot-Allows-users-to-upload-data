Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries such as streamlit, pandas, PyPDF2, and genai from google.generativeai.

Define Preprocessing Functions: Create functions to preprocess text data, CSV data, and extract text from a PDF file. These functions will handle cleaning and structuring the data for better comprehension by the language model.

Main Function: Define the main function main() that serves as the entry point for the Streamlit application.

User Interface: Within the main function, design the user interface using Streamlit. Allow users to choose the type of data they want to upload (PDF or CSV) and provide options for file upload.

Data Processing: Based on the user's selection, preprocess the uploaded data using the appropriate preprocessing function.

Question Input: Prompt the user to input their question related to the uploaded data.

Question Answering: When the user clicks the "Ask" button, combine the context (uploaded data) with the user's question and use the Gemini API to generate an answer.

Display Answer: Display the generated answer to the user on the Streamlit interface.

Entry Point: Finally, set the entry point to call the main() function when the script is executed.
